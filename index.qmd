## Testimonials part 1
- "I have found CSCAR to be immensely helpful for several projects and they are a valuable part of the institution."

- "This is a critical service to the University in general and specifically faculty. When I contacted such a service where I completed my PhD, the consultant wanted me to use what she knew and was used to and not what I wanted to measure. I have an approved proposal from my committee and the IRB and was not changing it to her comfortability with stats."

- "So glad to have CSCAR at UM!"

## Testimonials part 2
- "CSCAR has been an invaluable resource to me, my colleagues, and our many research rotators over the years. As research manager for the UofM Cancer Genetics program, meeting with your team is one of the first things I recommend those embarking on a new project.  Your team has been involved in shaping our studies, ensuring we are using the most up-to-date and sound methodology, and consulting on a wide range of matters from initial design, coding questions, interpreting results, manuscript preparation, responding to reviewer critiques, and more."

## Testimonials part 3
- "When speaking with prospective clinicians interviewing at the U, I often highlight CSCAR as an example of the supportive research infrastructure UofM offers. The ability for clinicians to partake in research is one of the selling points of our institution and what gives it a competitive edge. Removing this critical support is a huge loss."

- "...I know the dismantling of CSCAR will massively impact research quality, particularly by those who are not as stats oriented and depend on CSCAR for their services. Additionally, I have attended one of CSCAR's stats trainings during my first year and I know that many other people have benefitted, as well."

## Testimonials part 4
- "We were running an NSF-funded study with a fractional factorial design.  A CSCAR consultant identified a key statistical error that we missed.  This was something that nobody on my team, and none of the NSF peer reviewers, had picked up on.  The CSCAR consultant saved us a lot of time and money by preventing a major mistake that threatened the viability of the entire project.  We couldn't be more thankful for CSCARâ€™s expertise."

- "Had no idea CSCAR existed until last week. Great resource for those without a stats background."
